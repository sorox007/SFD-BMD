# Sheer force Diagram and Bending Moment Diagram Depictor in Python

This program tries to calculate and display the sheer force diagram and bending moment diagram when load values are given.
I am still working on this project and will try actively try to improve it but it has it's very limited as of now.

## Features

1. Calculating and Displaying a sheer force diagram using matplot


## Limitations
1. Has been tested for 2 load points and 1 support point for sheer force diagram only.
2. The graph might not work for more than 2 load points (Trying to make the program better)

**The Bending moment Diagram feature is still being built**
